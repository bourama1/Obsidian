A _concertina_ is a less charming kind of accordion.

In addition to knocking out a killer polka, a creature playing the _concertina_ can use an action to cause an area of mist or water up to 30 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep to freeze solid.

Once used, this feature of the _concertina_ can't be used again until the next dawn.

Any creatures touching the floor must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb) by the ice. As an action, a [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb) creature can attempt to free itself or another creature within its reach from the ice, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A character freed from the ice is no longer [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb) by it. The ice melts in an hour.
