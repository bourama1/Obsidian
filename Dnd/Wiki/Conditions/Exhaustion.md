### Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.

| Level | Effect |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1     |        disadvantage on checks|
| 2     |       1/2 speed |
| 3     |      disadvantage on attack and save  |
| 4     |        1/2 max HP|
| 5     |      0 speed  |
| 6     | Death       |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.  
A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has [disadvantage](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Disadvantage "5e SRD:Disadvantage") on ability checks.  
An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.  
Finishing a [long rest](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Long_Rest "5e SRD:Long Rest") reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.
