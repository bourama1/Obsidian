### Dexterity

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

#### Dexterity Checks

A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The [Acrobatics](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Acrobatics_Skill "5e SRD:Acrobatics Skill"), [Sleight of Hand](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Sleight_of_Hand_Skill "5e SRD:Sleight of Hand Skill"), and [Stealth](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Stealth_Skill "5e SRD:Stealth Skill") skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

_**Acrobatics.**_ Your Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Acrobatics_Skill "5e SRD:Acrobatics Skill")) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Acrobatics_Skill "5e SRD:Acrobatics Skill")) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

_**Sleight of Hand.**_ Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Sleight_of_Hand_Skill "5e SRD:Sleight of Hand Skill")) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Sleight_of_Hand_Skill "5e SRD:Sleight of Hand Skill")) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

_**Stealth.**_ Make a Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Stealth_Skill "5e SRD:Stealth Skill")) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

_**Other Dexterity Checks.**_ The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
-   Steer a chariot around a tight turn
-   Pick a lock
-   Disable a trap
-   Securely tie up a prisoner
-   Wriggle free of bonds
-   Play a stringed instrument
-   Craft a small or detailed object

#### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a [sling](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Sling "5e SRD:Sling") or a [longbow](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Longbow "5e SRD:Longbow"). You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a [dagger](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Dagger "5e SRD:Dagger") or a [rapier](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Rapier "5e SRD:Rapier").

#### Armor Class

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.

#### Initiative

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat.

##### Hiding

The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Stealth_Skill "5e SRD:Stealth Skill")) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom "5e SRD:Wisdom") ([Perception](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Perception_Skill "5e SRD:Perception Skill")) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.

An [invisible](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Invisible "5e SRD:Conditions") creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain [advantage](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Advantage "5e SRD:Advantage") on an attack roll before you are seen.

_**Passive Perception.**_ When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Stealth_Skill "5e SRD:Stealth Skill")) check with that creature's passive [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom "5e SRD:Wisdom") ([Perception](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Perception_Skill "5e SRD:Perception Skill")) score, which equals 10 + the creature's [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom "5e SRD:Wisdom") modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has [advantage](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Advantage "5e SRD:Advantage"), add 5. For [disadvantage](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Disadvantage "5e SRD:Disadvantage"), subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom "5e SRD:Wisdom") of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in [Perception](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Perception_Skill "5e SRD:Perception Skill"), he or she has a passive [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom "5e SRD:Wisdom") ([Perception](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Perception_Skill "5e SRD:Perception Skill")) of 14.

_**What Can You See?**_ One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained in "[The Environment](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Vision_and_Light "5e SRD:Vision and Light")."
