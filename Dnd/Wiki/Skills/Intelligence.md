An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The [Arcana](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Arcana_Skill "5e SRD:Arcana Skill"), [History](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:History_Skill "5e SRD:History Skill"), [Investigation](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Investigation_Skill "5e SRD:Investigation Skill"), [Nature](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Nature_Skill "5e SRD:Nature Skill"), and [Religion](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Religion_Skill "5e SRD:Religion Skill") skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse.

-   Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
-   Forge a document
