Acrid odors cling to this stained, heavy volume. The book's metal fittings are copper, iron, lead, silver, and gold, some frozen mid-transition from one metal to another. When found, the book contains the following spells: [enlarge/reduce](https://5e.tools/spells.html#enlarge%2freduce_phb), [feather fall](https://5e.tools/spells.html#feather%20fall_phb), [flesh to stone](https://5e.tools/spells.html#flesh%20to%20stone_phb), [gaseous form](https://5e.tools/spells.html#gaseous%20form_phb), [magic weapon](https://5e.tools/spells.html#magic%20weapon_phb), and [polymorph](https://5e.tools/spells.html#polymorph_phb). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

-   If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the transmutation school.
-   As an action, you can touch a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried and spend a number of charges to transform the target into another object. For 1 charge, the object can be no larger than 1 foot on a side. You can spend additional charges to increase the maximum dimensions by 2 feet per charge. The new object must have a gold value equal to or less than the original.
