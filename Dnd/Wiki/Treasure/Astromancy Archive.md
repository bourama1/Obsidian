This brass disc of articulated, concentric rings unfolds into an armillary sphere. As a bonus action, you can unfold it into the sphere or back into a disc. When found, it contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to it: [augury](https://5e.tools/spells.html#augury_phb), [divination](https://5e.tools/spells.html#divination_phb), [find the path](https://5e.tools/spells.html#find%20the%20path_phb), [foresight](https://5e.tools/spells.html#foresight_phb), [locate creature](https://5e.tools/spells.html#locate%20creature_phb), and [locate object](https://5e.tools/spells.html#locate%20object_phb). It functions as a spellbook for you, with spells encoded on the rings.

While you are holding the archive, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The archive has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

-   If you spend 1 minute studying the archive, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the archive. The new spell must be of the divination school.
-   When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and force the creature to roll a d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the original roll. You can do this after you see the roll but before its effects are applied.
