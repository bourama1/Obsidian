When you drink a _potion of mind control_, you can cast a dominate spell (save DC 15) on a specific creature if you do so before the end of your next turn. If you don't, the potion is wasted.

A _potion of mind control_ produces the effect of a [dominate beast](https://5e.tools/spells.html#dominate%20beast_phb) spell. If the target's initial saving throw fails, the effect lasts for 1 hour, with no concentration required on your part. The [charmed](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#charmed_phb) creature has disadvantage on new saving throws to break the effect during this time.
