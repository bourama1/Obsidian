_Soul coin_s are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each _soul coin_ has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.

### Carrying Soul Coins. 

To hold a _soul coin_ is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair.

An evil creature can carry as many _soul coin_s as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of _soul coin_s equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of _soul coin_s greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

### Using a Soul Coin. 

A _soul coin_ has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a _soul coin_ and use it to do one of the following:

-   Drain Life. You siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.

-   Query. You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.
   

### Freeing a Soul. 

Casting a spell that removes a curse on a _soul coin_ frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from _soul coin_s typically emerge from the River Styx as [lemure](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#lemure_mm) devils.

A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A _soul coin_ has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a [hellfire weapon](https://5e.tools/items.html#hellfire%20weapon_bgdia) or an infernal war machine's furnace (see "[Soul Fuel](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#bgdia,11,soul%20fuel,0)").

Freeing a soul from a _soul coin_ is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.

### Hellish Currency. 

_Soul coin_s are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.

_Soul coin_s are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.
